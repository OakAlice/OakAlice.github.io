- Ecological Society of Australia, Adelaide (Australia), December 2025: From Prediction to Interpretation: Post-Processing to Refine Behavioural Classifications from Animal Accelerometry. Oral presentation.
- 3MT, Sippy Downs (Australia), August 2025: Sport's Watches for Animals. Oral Presentation. Awarded winner 3MT for science department, 3rd place and people's choice for overall university.
- Society of Experimental Biology, Antwerp (Belgium), July 2025: Practical guidelines for validation of supervised machine learning models in accelerometer-based animal behaviour classification. Poster.
- Australiasian Society for the Study of Animal Behaviour, Armidale (Australia), June 2025: Ignoring what we don't know in animal behaviour classification. Oral presentation. Awarded best student talk.
- Australian and New Zealand Society for Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry, Gatton (Australia), December 2023: A Biologist's Guide To Machine Leanrning - Accelerometer Animal Activity Recognition Explained. Poster. Awarded people's choice best poster.
