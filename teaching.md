I am passionate about teaching, particualrly R and data skills.

## Intermediate R for Animal Ecologists
In 2025, I updated the R teaching resources for a 2nd year ecology course I was tutoring at my university. Noticing that some students were excelling with the existing content and going above and beyond with their coding efforts, I began developing additional extension materials to expose these students to new skills and concepts within R. With feedback from these students, I subsequntly expanded the extension scripts to a fully independent, self-paced 8 module teaching course. This content is available for use by any interested student: [Intermediate R for Animal Ecologists](https://github.com/OakAlice/IntermediateRForAnimalEcologists/tree/main)
