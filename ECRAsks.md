title: ECR Asks

As part of my role on the media committee for the [Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology (SORTEE)](https://www.sortee.org/) I began a science communication interview series. This series, ‘ECR Asks’ is a monthly Q&A sessions where I speak with experienced SORTEE members to explore their journey in, and perspectives on, open science and transparent research. This series aims to answer big questions and share practical insights to support early career researchers like myself to navigate the ever evolving landscape of open science and academia. These have been massively informative and fun conversations, and I'm so grateful to the researchers I've spoken with for generously sharing their time and insights. Below I have linked to the SORTEE website where these interviews have been published.
