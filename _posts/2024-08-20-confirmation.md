## Confirmation

Below is a recording of my confirmation talk, given at the University of the Sunshine Coast in August of 2024, just over 1 year into my canditure. Sadly the opening slide animation (with a koala climbing down a tree) didn't render for the zoom recording but everything else did - so that's okay. I had a lot of fun presenting and look forward to more opportunities to share my research.

Feb 2025 Edit: PhDs progress quickly, in the six months since giving this talk, I have progressed enough that much of the information in this talk is now out of date! Nevertheless, it gives a nice overview of what I had originally intended.
