## Behaviour is a Sequence, Not a Snapshot (August AESS Presentation)

This August I gave a talk as part of the University of the Sunshine Coast 'Animal Ecology Seminar Series'. For this talk, I presented my 3rd PhD chapter (and soon to be submitted 3rd paper) on the use of post-processing to improve machine learning accelerometer-based animal behaviour classifications using the broader sequential context to inform higher-order patterns. As this talk was recorded, I thought it might be nice to upload it :).
