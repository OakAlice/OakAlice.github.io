## When Did The Koala Cross The Road?
Although I had spent the majority of my undergrad moving towards an honours in evolutionary psychology, various limitations of my degree meant my honours had to have a primary supervisor located in the School of Biology and through a series of connections I was lead back to Professor Robbie Wilson. I had met Robbie in my first semester as an undergraduate where he had stood out from the other professors as someone totally willing, keen even, to entertain my questions that walked that fascinating line between what is and what should be in discussions of dominance, rule-breaking, and sexual selection. By the time I reconnected with him three years later, he was no longer working on those kind of questions but instead generously offered me a project to understand when - and why - koalas cross the road. "I'm not interested in koalas", I apparently said (cringy and utterly mistaken words my friends now gleefully quote back at me!) but I agreed to the project and began the research project that would change my life...

### Koalas Are Not Cute and Cuddly
_Brief reflective originally published on [the website for my honours research group](https://www.wilsonperformancelab.com/www.wilsonperformancelab.com/2022/11/15/koalas-are-not-cute-and-cuddly), 'The Performance Lab' at University of Queensland, upon the completion of my honours in 2022._

"Koalas are not cute and cuddly. Although they might look like it from a distance, up close and personal with a koala, they alternate between rumbling like a behemoth and high-pitched screaming like a flock of birds. Their claws, built to pierce tree trunks, easily slice through thick canvas, through Ben’s pants, through Ben’s boots, through Ben’s flesh. (Ben, 8m up a tree, dangling by a rope, trying not to drop the koala, yelps.) And that’s if you can even find the koalas at all. They’re really, really, really hard to find.

Koalas, one of Australia’s most beloved and iconic species, are going extinct. Surveys estimate there could be as few as 32,000 remaining in the wild, and as of February 2022 they were officially reclassified as endangered. Most of their population decline is caused by ground-based threats such as car strikes and dog attacks, so to save the koala, conservation efforts could benefit from focusing on this specific period. While lots of amazing research has been done on koala movement, up until now we’ve lacked the technology to undertake really fine-scale analyses. That’s where my honours came in: To combine GPS with fine-scale movement detecting devices called accelerometers, allowing us to determine every behaviour the koala did while wearing it.

While simple enough on paper, this honours took me on a ride into the world of big-data, machine learning, and all kinds of fun. Although it could be frustrating waiting for the poor old computer to crunch the numbers (one week, I got so fed up, I automated everything and went on a three day hike… after which I came back to the office and found it still processing. Hmm.) working with the data from this technology was a hugely exciting and fulfilling experience that made me eager to pursue more data-based research in future. I also massively enjoyed the fieldwork component with our team, the Hidden Vale biologists, and the koala experts Bill, Sean, and Ben, whose research is excellent, but fire-side banter is even better.

Overall, there were the usual challenges and tribulations as with any project, but I was blessed with a project that I was excited by enough to spend countless hours researching obscure analysis methods for. Most of all I am exceptionally lucky to have been a part of the Wilson lab culture, and to have had so many people help me with fieldwork and analysis, yes, but having a good laugh and making the long office hours go fast."

### Watch This Space!
While the sample size from my honours was insufficient to publish independently, fortunately, the project was continued by a PhD student who was able to double the number of tagged koalas, including a variety of habitat types. When I began my PhD on improving the machine learning methods for fine-scale behaviour analysis I got back involved with the project, designing and implementing the machine learning behavioural workflow. Analyses are still ongoing but fingers-crossed, watch this space for forthcoming results! As a bit of a teaser for what's to come, I have attached my honour's poster, presented as preliminary results at the 'Ecological Society of Australia' annual conference in 2022.
