## CV

### Bachelor of Advanced Science (Hnrs)
**University of Queensland, 2019 - 2021**  
Majored in biology but undertook a significant amount of psychology coursework and research in evolutionary psychology. For my honours research, I used GPS and accelerometer behaviour recognition machine learning to identify critical periods when koalas undertake ground traverses. The exposure to big data and machine learning in this project inspired me to learn to code.

### Science Communication Intern
**The Daily Journal, 2021** 
Provided weekly science communication newspaper articles across a broad range of scientific subjects, catering for a general audience.

### Graduate Ecologist
**Eco Logical Australia, 2023 - 2024**  
Assisting with a range of government and private sector projects, primarily in a data-based capacity designing data-management procedures, ensuring quality, and undertaking statistical analyses for clients.

### PhD
**University of the Sunshine Coast, 2023 - present**  
Thesis:
- "Use of Machine Learning in Animal Accelerometer Behaviour Recognition"
Papers:
- "A Biologger's Guide to Machine Learning Validation: Case study in Animal Accelerometer Behaviour Recognition" (in review)
