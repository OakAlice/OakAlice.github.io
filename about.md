## CV

#### Bachelor of Advanced Science (Hnrs), University of Queensland, 2019 - 2021
Majored in biology but undertook significant coursework and research in evolutionary psychology. Honours research focused on GPS and accelerometer-based behavioural recognition to identify critical periods of koala ground traverses. This exposure to machine learning sparking an interest in learning to code.

#### Science Communication Intern, The Daily Journal, 2021
Produced weekly science communication articles for a general audience.

#### Graduate Ecologist, Eco Logical Australia, 2023 - 2024
Focused on designing data management procedures, ensuring data quality, and conducting statistical analyses for government and private sector projects.

#### PhD Candidate, University of the Sunshine Coast, 2023 - present
Thesis: "Use of Machine Learning in Animal Accelerometer Behavior Recognition"
